Today we learned how to grab our profile, add a **repository** to git and then **commit** and **push** to the origin on github. This page was created doing just that!. Below will be a list of the way to the add the updated files to Github. 

1. To add all the changes, in the termninal type **git add .** , and that will add all the files, or you can do single files by doing **git status** and then selecting the file to add.
2. next you need to commit the files by typing **git remote -v** and that will push it to the master.
3. the final step is to type git **push origin master** and that will push it to *Github* and ask you to put in your Github username and password.
4. ### All done and Rejoice!! ###

+ almost forgot! after step 1, make sure to type in **git commit -m "say what you changed" as this will commit the file and add a message to it describing what you changed.
