Oh boy, where to start. The **Command Line**!! at first I was very hesistant because I have tried tackling it before with only frustration. Looking for files was always a pain as I thought I had to know the file name. After the Tutorial, However, I dont need to know anything. Just need to know how to pull up a list with **_LS_**. after doing that just a coupleof slashes and then im where I need to be. Now I just gotta learn what all the Config files do. The other thing that really stuck out to me what the great addition of **TAB**. Wow tab is helpful. Cant figure out how to spell something but know how to start it, Whammy Tab is here. Tab just autocompletes stuff. If you **LS double tab** it will show a very user friendly display of folders and then you can just select the one you want. 

### My Cheat Sheet
+ **LS** will list files and folders in a list allowing me to navigate easier
+ **PWD** will tell me where I am currently at in the terminal
+ **CD** will change directory from my current one
+ **Relative** Paths are paths in relation to where I am currently at in the system
+ **Absolute** paths are paths in in relation to the root of the system I am in
+ When I am referring to a file or folder, I need to be case sensative and also use 'blah blah' (The single ticks) in order to Negate the space.
+ Tab is my best friend as it will autocomplete and also using it with LS will display a bunch of folders that I can navigate through.

## Test #2
Took the Second Test for the Terminal questions and took me again....two attempts. The first I got a 4.33 which meant I was missing 2 selections of one of the questions. went back and realized I just forgot to select the other ways to find a folder. I like that there are 4 ways to find a file, I think ill do the one that I seem to grasp to the easiest. Second attempt I made up the lost points.
