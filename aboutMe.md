## My Growth Mindset

Growth Mindset to me is not only the ability to adapt and change to your environment but apply it as well. I do not believe in natural talent. I believe in **Hardwork** and **committment**. If you have the mindset you are a <em>Natural</em> at something then you will not push yourself to see how far you can go. The <strong>Growth Mindset</strong> is about constantly failing, then learning and then failing again. No one has ever learned anything from Winning. They Learn from losing and making mistakes. If you believe you have nothing left to learn, you will never learn anything.
