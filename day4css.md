                            Chapter 10 CSS

1. CSS works by styling the HTML page. You can style specific pieces of the information that you have added to HTML or do entire sections. HTML is the Canvas and CSS is the paint. Declarations tell HTML how to render the information. They are Made up of 2 pieces of information. Property and Value. 
2. Links live inside the Head element while Hrefs live inside the actualy body of the HTML page.
3. HTML pages can use more than one CSS style sheet.
4. You can add a style tag to the HTML page to make all your CSS in the HTML page itself or you can create a seperate CSS page and Link it to HTML. 
5. CSS uses specificity and gives the selector a value. The higher the value the more precedence it has. an ID is more specific than h1 for instance. 
6. You can Apply !important to any property value to make it more important than other rules applied
7. inheritance means that any child tags will get the styling of the parent unless otherwise specified. if I style the body red then my h1,p,divs all will be styled similar unless a more specific style is used. 
8. it is better to keep your CSS file seperate from your HTML file.
9. UL is for unordered list and OL is ordered list. UL will make bulleted list and OL will make numbered list.
