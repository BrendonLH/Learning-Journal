## Day 1


Today I completed the First quiz following the class on GitHub **Markdown**. It took me two attempts to get a 5 of 5 with the first being a 4.67. After doing some math, I realized that the only way I could have got a 4.67 would be that I missed one of the selections on the first question. After reviewing my answer, I forgot to add the '+' as one of the possible chooices to make an *unordered* list item. I am a firm believer in completeing my work or at least giving it the best shot I can. Whether working out or doing computer work. For me it would be like only running 3 miles of a 5k. I could see the finish line but decide that I went far enough rather than complete it. Na, I think ill finish.
