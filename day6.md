                                                    Computer Architecture and Logic

1. Computers started out as basic calculators that only worked with numbers.
2. All computers do 4 things.
    + inputs give the computer info to store.
    + processing take information from storage to make an output.
    + Storage is where all the data from input is stored.
3. Data and binary
    + smallest piece of information is called a bit.
        1. Binary number system = 0 & 1.
        2. any number can be represented by 1's and 0's
        3. with binary you can translate letters. 
    + Data is made up of on/off true/false wires. 
    + images are represented in pixels which can be represented by binary.
    + this is the backbone of input process store output.
4. Circuits and Logic

--------------------------
                                Loops
                                pages 70-76

1. Common types of loops
    + **For**- use for a specific number of times.
    + **While**- if you dont know how many times it needs to run.
    + **Do while**- while a condition is true run the code.
2. three points to loops
    + Keywords
        1. *Break*- stop the code at a point.
        2. *Continue* checks if the condition is still true.
    + Loops/Arrays
    + Perormance Issues
    + If a condition never returns false, you can get an inifinite loop === Bad
