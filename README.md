## The Point of this Journal!

1. To Document all the <strong>AWESOME!</strong> things I am going to learn in the coming weeks leading up to course 201 and Beyond!
2. To Look back at a later time and laugh at my <em>frustrations</em> with coding
3. To submit the assignment to the class 
- also to add a **Bold** and _italic_ markdowns to complete the 5 Markdowns needed.

## My Growth Mindset

Growth Mindset to me is not only the ability to adapt and change to your environment but apply it as well. I do not believe in natural talent. I believe in **Hardwork** and **committment**. If you have the mindset you are a <em>Natural</em> at something then you will not push yourself to see how far you can go. The <strong>Growth Mindset</strong> is about constantly failing, then learning and then failing again. No one has ever learned anything from Winning. They Learn from losing and making mistakes. If you believe you have nothing left to learn, you will never learn anything.
