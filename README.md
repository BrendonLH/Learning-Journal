## The Point of this Journal!

1. To Document all the <strong>AWESOME!</strong> things I am going to learn in the coming weeks leading up to course 201 and Beyond!
2. To Look back at a later time and laugh at my <em>frustrations</em> with coding
3. To submit the assignment to the class 
- also to add a **Bold** and _italic_ markdowns to complete the 5 Markdowns needed.

## My Growth Mindset

Growth Mindset to me is not only the ability to adapt and change to your environment but apply it as well. I do not believe in natural talent. I believe in **Hardwork** and **committment**. If you have the mindset you are a <em>Natural</em> at something then you will not push yourself to see how far you can go. The <strong>Growth Mindset</strong> is about constantly failing, then learning and then failing again. No one has ever learned anything from Winning. They Learn from losing and making mistakes. If you believe you have nothing left to learn, you will never learn anything.

## September 17th 2019

Today I completed the First quiz following the class on GitHub **Markdown**. It took me two attempts to get a 5 of 5 with the first being a 4.67. After doing some math, I realized that the only way I could have got a 4.67 would be that I missed one of the selections on the first question. After reviewing my answer, I forgot to add the '+' as one of the possible chooices to make an *unordered* list item. I am a firm believer in completeing my work or at least giving it the best shot I can. Whether working out or doing computer work. For me it would be like only running 3 miles of a 5k. I could see the finish line but decide that I went far enough rather than complete it. Na, I think ill finish.

Before I write about class, I need to make note that the guy at safeway only gave me two chicken strips rather than my tradional three lol. Unfortuantely I have a certain amount of food I have to eat to maintain 202. The nice thing though is right now I get to eat whatever I want. ok, enough of fitness talk. The second day of 102 class was Absolutely **AWESOME!**. I learned so much that I did not know before. Ubuntu, what a great way to move around a system. I have already been googling quick shortcuts and other CMD's to make me more profficient. I think the thing I like the most is I can open up programs without needing to double click anything. I hate the mouse so anything to keep me from using it becomes a scar in my brain, I dont forget it.

I think im going to start bringing chocolate milk to class though. Anytime I have to think or do math, sucking down some nectar of life always makes me more fluid in my thought process. Tonight I will be doing the Second Quiz. I think this one will be alittle harder than the last only because I havent fully got the CMD's engrained into my head yet. The syntax I think is what is tripping me up a bit. I'll get it though. Usually if I get stuck on something I end up dreaming about it and then the solution comes to me. Last time I was having a function problem and I just gave myself some time from it and then **_Eureka!_** I woke up and I had it in my head before I even coded it down. The Human brain is so unique. Its almost like it evolves as you learn in real time rather than thousands of years. It makes you wonder though. If its not my conscious that is solving these when I dream the solution, Who is solving it? 

so what I learned in class. I learned that operating systems username is different that what I thought I made it when i bought the computer. I was having trouble with ESlint being downloaded and the problem was Ubuntu was trying to talk with my Windows but the Username I entered into a copy and paste part was different than the one I initially setup. Once I was guided through this proccess, Everything worked perfect and my computer was happy.
