## The Point of this Journal!

1. To Document all the <strong>AWESOME!</strong> things I am going to learn in the coming weeks leading up to course 201 and Beyond!
2. To Look back at a later time and laugh at my <em>frustrations</em> with coding
3. To submit the assignment to the class 
- also to add a **Bold** and _italic_ markdowns to complete the 5 Markdowns needed.

## My Growth Mindset

Growth Mindset to me is not only the ability to adapt and change to your environment but apply it as well. I do not believe in natural talent. I believe in **Hardwork** and **committment**. If you have the mindset you are a <em>Natural</em> at something then you will not push yourself to see how far you can go. The <strong>Growth Mindset</strong> is about constantly failing, then learning and then failing again. No one has ever learned anything from Winning. They Learn from losing and making mistakes. If you believe you have nothing left to learn, you will never learn anything.

## September 17th 2019

Today I completed the First quiz following the class on GitHub **Markdown**. It took me two attempts to get a 5 of 5 with the first being a 4.67. After doing some math, I realized that the only way I could have got a 4.67 would be that I missed one of the selections on the first question. After reviewing my answer, I forgot to add the '+' as one of the possible chooices to make an *unordered* list item. I am a firm believer in completeing my work or at least giving it the best shot I can. Whether working out or doing computer work. For me it would be like only running 3 miles of a 5k. I could see the finish line but decide that I went far enough rather than complete it. Na, I think ill finish.

oh boy, where to start. The **Command Line**!! at first I was very hesistant because I have tried tackling it before with only frustration. Looking for files was always a pain as I thought I had to know the file name. After the Tutorial, However, I dont need to know anything. Just need to know how to pull up a list with **_LS_**. after doing that just a coupleof slashes and then im where I need to be. Now I just gotta learn what all the Config files do. The other thing that really stuck out to me what the great addition of **TAB**. Wow tab is helpful. Cant figure out how to spell something but know how to start it, Whammy Tab is here. Tab just autocompletes stuff. If you **LS double tab** it will show a very user friendly display of folders and then you can just select the one you want. 

### My Cheat Sheet
+ **LS** will list files and folders in a list allowing me to navigate easier
+ **PWD** will tell me where I am currently at in the terminal
+ **CD** will change directory from my current one
+ **Relative** Paths are paths in relation to where I am currently at in the system
+ **Absolute** paths are paths in in relation to the root of the system I am in
+ When I am referring to a file or folder, I need to be case sensative and also use 'blah blah' (The single ticks) in order to Negate the space.
+ Tab is my best friend as it will autocomplete and also using it with LS will display a bunch of folders that I can navigate through.
