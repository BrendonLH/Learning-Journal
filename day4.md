1. building a target audience. Think about age range, Gender, Income demographic, rural or urban areas ect. invent some characters/customers to get an idea. ask what the customer would want in this situation.
2. Discover the **motivations** and **Goals** of the audience visiting your site. General entertainment? Personal or proff.? is the time spent on your site essential  or a luxery.
3. create a list of why people are coming to your site. Purchasing something, general information, looking at reviews, general entertainment. 
4. prioritze information based on goals of visitor from key points to background (non essentail) information. Make your site relevent. 
5. how often to update your site depends on what you offer. If its information, update more frequently than if it was a service. How often do visitors return? how often does your service change? how often is information updated?
6. Sketch out wireframes of where each piece of info will go. focus on the information and not pictures, fonts, colors ect. Online wireframe tools [GoMockingBird](http://gomockingbird.com) and [Lovely Charts](http://lovelycharts.com) are two examples. 
7. the aim of design is to communicate information on a page that users can understand. **Organize and Prioritize** information. Group related information together to make it simpler to read/understand for the user.
8. use the **Visual Hierarchy** to get across key information to user. This will help users get to what their looking for. LARGER ELEMENTS grab users attention first, color can draw attention, _style_ makes something stand out. If nothing on your site stands out it can be uninteresting. 
9. Grouping and Similarity. Proximity, Closure, Continuance, White Space, Color and Borders can all make information look similar. 
10. Site Navigation. Helps users find where they want to go and what the site is about. The navigation bar should be Concise, Clear and Selective. Navigation should be quick, easy to read, predictable and reflect sections of the site.

                            Chapter 10 CSS

1. CSS works by styling the HTML page. You can style specific pieces of the information that you have added to HTML or do entire sections. HTML is the Canvas and CSS is the paint. Declarations tell HTML how to render the information. They are Made up of 2 pieces of information. Property and Value. 
2. Links live inside the Head element while Hrefs live inside the actualy body of the HTML page.
3. HTML pages can use more than one CSS style sheet.
4. You can add a style tag to the HTML page to make all your CSS in the HTML page itself or you can create a seperate CSS page and Link it to HTML. 
5. CSS uses specificity and gives the selector a value. The higher the value the more precedence it has. an ID is more specific than h1 for instance. 
6. You can Apply !important to any property value to make it more important than other rules applied
7. inheritance means that any child tags will get the styling of the parent unless otherwise specified. if I style the body red then my h1,p,divs all will be styled similar unless a more specific style is used. 
8. it is better to keep your CSS file seperate from your HTML file.
