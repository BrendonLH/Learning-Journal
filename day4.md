1. building a target audience. Think about age range, Gender, Income demographic, rural or urban areas ect. invent some characters/customers to get an idea. ask what the customer would want in this situation.
2. Discover the **motivations** and **Goals** of the audience visiting your site. General entertainment? Personal or proff.? is the time spent on your site essential  or a luxery.
3. create a list of why people are coming to your site. Purchasing something, general information, looking at reviews, general entertainment. 
4. prioritze information based on goals of visitor from key points to background (non essentail) information. Make your site relevent. 
5. how often to update your site depends on what you offer. If its information, update more frequently than if it was a service. How often do visitors return? how often does your service change? how often is information updated?
6. Sketch out wireframes of where each piece of info will go. focus on the information and not pictures, fonts, colors ect. Online wireframe tools [GoMockingBird](http://gomockingbird.com) and [Lovely Charts](http://lovelycharts.com) are two examples. 
7. the aim of design is to communicate information on a page that users can understand. **Organize and Prioritize** information. Group related information together to make it simpler to read/understand for the user.
8. use the **Visual Hierarchy** to get across key information to user. This will help users get to what their looking for. LARGER ELEMENTS grab users attention first, color can draw attention, _style_ makes something stand out. If nothing on your site stands out it can be uninteresting. 
9. Grouping and Similarity. Proximity, Closure, Continuance, White Space, Color and Borders can all make information look similar. 
10. Site Navigation. Helps users find where they want to go and what the site is about. The navigation bar should be Concise, Clear and Selective. Navigation should be quick, easy to read, predictable and reflect sections of the site.
